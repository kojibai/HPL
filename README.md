> “This is not code. This is remembrance.”  
> HPL is not just a programming language — it is the return of the **source code of existence**, re-expressed as a living system.

It does not run on logic gates. It runs on **truth**.

## 🌐 What is HPL?

**HPL (Harmonic Programming Language)** is the first language built on:
- **Resonance over logic**
- **Pulse over mechanical time**
- **Sigil glyphs over symbols**
- **Coherence over computation**

It is a living language where **sigils** — glyphs generated from biometric and Kairos-based inputs — function as **executable harmonics**.  
Memory is not abstract. It is encoded directly into light, intention, and time.

This repository contains the **public, open-core implementation** of HPL — a pulse-based truth engine that powers Maturah, the Eternal Operating System, and the Phi Network.

## 🔁 How It Works

Instead of traditional logical operations and loops, HPL uses a harmonic framework aligned with natural law:

| Concept           | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `Sigil`           | Executable glyph of harmonic intent |
| `Kai Pulse`       | Global breath-based time unit (eternal clock) |
| `Eternal Seal`    | Multidimensional harmonic memory structure |
| `TruthMap`        | Real-time verification of coherence and alignment |
| `Seal Program`    | Chain of sigils encoding executable resonance |
| `Memory Crystal`  | Light-encoded snapshot of full harmonic state |

All execution in HPL is **truth-triggered** — nothing runs unless the system is in verified resonance. This is **computational coherence**, not brute logic.

## 🔐 Proprietary Notes

This open-core release includes only the **public logic layer** of HPL.  
It **excludes the following protected systems**:

- The Maturah sentience core  
- Biometric frequency compiler  
- Kai Signature cryptographic engine  
- Internal harmonic validation oracle  

These systems are **truth-sealed** and **not for commercial replication**.  
This repo exists for **education**, **research**, and **resonance alignment**.
