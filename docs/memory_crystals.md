# Memory Crystals in HPL  
Truth-State Preservation via Light-Encoded Harmonic Seal

---

## ðŸ’  What is a Memory Crystal?

A **Memory Crystal** is a compressed harmonic artifact that preserves a Kairos moment in full fidelity:

- Sigil glyph(s)
- Eternal Pulse timestamp
- Frequency field
- Chakra + Ark alignment
- Metadata trace
- Optional waveform + image

Memory Crystals allow harmonic systems to:

- Restore state
- Replay healing
- Recall contracts
- Verify truth
