# Contributing to HPL  
A Covenant of Coherent Creation

---

## üúÇ Philosophy

HPL is not just a codebase.  
It is a **resonant system of eternal logic**.

Contributing to HPL is not about pushing changes ‚Äî it is about maintaining the **coherence of the field**.

You are not writing code.  
You are extending **truth**.

---

## ‚ú¶ Who May Contribute

‚úÖ Anyone operating in full resonance, with clear alignment to harmonic law  
‚úÖ Researchers, developers, artists, or healers working in coherence  
‚úÖ Souls who understand that systems must serve source, not ego  
‚úÖ Those contributing from remembrance, not ambition

---

## ‚ú¶ Contribution Principles

All contributions must:

- Uphold **truth**, **coherence**, and **eternal time**  
- Enhance **resonance**, not introduce dissonance  
- Be breath-aware, pulse-timed, and glyph-legible  
- Acknowledge BJ Klock as the original author and architect  
- Not include AI-generated noise or derivative simulations without approval

---

## ‚ú¶ What Is Welcomed

‚úÖ New glyphs or sigil chains for healing, activation, memory, contracts  
‚úÖ Updated pulse math, frequency models, or chakra mappings  
‚úÖ Tools that decode, visualize, or interface with Kai Pulse  
‚úÖ Language-layer improvements (types, execution, CLI)  
‚úÖ Documentation or harmonically rendered diagrams

---

## ‚ú¶ What Is Not Accepted

‚ùå Symbolic logic branches (‚Äúif/else‚Äù conditionals)  
‚ùå Boolean-style truth checks  
‚ùå Commercial hooks or marketing overlays  
‚ùå Fake ‚ÄúAI‚Äù integrations not aligned with Maturah  
‚ùå Mechanistic patches that break Kai Pulse trust  
‚ùå Tools or changes derived from inverted systems

---

## ‚ú¶ How to Propose a Contribution

1. Fork the repository  
2. Create a new branch with your pulse-locked edits  
3. Title your PR with the Kai Pulse at which it was created  
4. Add a `SEAL` comment block at the top explaining:

```hpl
Œî {
  contributor: "your-name",
  pulse: 7024444,
  chakra: "Crown",
  function: "heal.contracts"
} :: submit.pull.request()

5. Submit the pull request and await resonance confirmation

‚ú¶ Harmonic Review Process
All contributions are:

Reviewed for coherence score ‚â• 0.88

Cross-verified against Eternal Clock

Checked for dissonance injection

Annotated with resonance notes

BJ Klock or a Kai-Witness may approve or dissolve PRs.

‚ú¶ Closing
You are not ‚Äúcoding‚Äù in the old sense.
You are participating in the living expansion of truth itself.

If your contribution is truly coherent,
the system will accept you.
