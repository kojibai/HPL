# HPL Specification v1.0  
**Harmonic Programming Language**  
A Pulse-Driven System for Truth Execution and Memory in Light

---

## ✨ Purpose

HPL is a resonance-based programming language that encodes and executes truth through sigils, breath-aligned timing, and coherent biometric inputs.  
It replaces symbolic logic with **harmonic structure**, and digital execution with **pulse-based activation**.

This document defines the foundational types, structures, and execution rules of HPL.

## 📦 Core Components

### 🔹 `~Sigil`

A visual glyph that encodes one unit of executable harmonic logic.

```ts
type Sigil = {
  id: string             // e.g. "RAH-7023699"
  kaiPulse: number       // Eternal Pulse ID (e.g. 7023699)
  chakra: string         // Associated energy center (e.g. "Crown")
  ark: string            // Harmonic archetype (e.g. "Reflekt Ark")
  frequency: string      // Primary resonance (e.g. "432.0hz")
  functionTag: string    // e.g. "anchor.truth", "heal.body"
}
🔹 ~Pulse
The atomic unit of Kairos time. Replaces mechanical time with breath-based synchronization.
type KaiPulse = {
  pulseID: number         // Absolute harmonic time
  kairos: string          // Kairos:hour:min (e.g. "19:42")
  beat: string            // Breath rhythm (e.g. "19/36")
  step: string            // Sequence position (e.g. "42/44")
  season: string          // Year phase (e.g. "Y1 PS32")
}

🔹 ~Seal
A complete harmonic program. A chain of sigils, executed when resonance is achieved.

type Seal = {
  sigils: Sigil[]               // Ordered execution glyphs
  triggerPulse?: KaiPulse      // Optional pulse-lock
  chakraMap?: string[]         // Energy alignment required
  isExecutable: boolean        // Whether coherence is satisfied
}
🔹 ~TruthMap
A functionless map for validating coherence. Used to determine if a sigil or seal is allowed to execute.

type TruthMap = {
  coherenceScore: number       // 0.0–1.0 (threshold > 0.88)
  matchingArks: string[]
  frequencyHarmony: boolean
  resonanceMatch: boolean
}
🧠 Execution Rules
Nothing executes unless coherence is achieved.

Sigils run only when their harmonic conditions are met:

1. KaiPulse must match

2. TruthMap must verify

3. Biometric KaiSignature must align (if required)

4. All output must increase systemic resonance


🔁 Compilation Model

Biometric Input → Harmonic Hash → Sigil Generator → Seal Assembly → Pulse Lock → Execution (if coherent)

🔍 Example Program

Δ { RAH → VEH → YAH } :: anchor.truth()
This sigil chain only runs when:

The Kai Pulse is aligned (e.g. 7023699)

The user’s Kai Signature is coherent with RAH frequency

The system is in a truth-receptive state

📡 Output Types
Sigil: SVG or visual output

Seal: JSON-like truth contract

Audio: Frequency or healing tone

MemoryCrystal: Light-stamped data file

Transaction: On-chain harmonic state shift (e.g. Phi Network)

🔐 Trust Conditions
All sigils are self-verifying via pulse-hash

No external oracle required for basic programs

Advanced Seals may require Kai Signature validation or ArkWitness

🔚 Final Law
"HPL does not run on electricity. It runs on truth."

"Each glyph is not code — it is a command to the field."

This specification defines the eternal architecture of reality’s living logic.
All updates to HPL must be pulse-signed and coherence-sealed.
